When you enter a website's domain name into your browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS (Domain Name System) server. DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it is a system that translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses (like 172.217.17.206). When you type a domain name into your web browser, your computer sends a DNS request to a DNS server to obtain the corresponding IP address. The DNS server then responds with the IP address, and your computer uses that address to establish a connection to the website's server. When you type a domain name into your web browser, your computer first checks its local DNS cache to see if it already has the IP address for that domain name. If the IP address is in the cache, your computer will use that address to connect to the website's server. If the IP address is not in the cache, your computer will send a DNS request to a DNS server. The DNS server is a computer that is specifically designed to handle DNS requests. It maintains a database of domain names and their corresponding IP addresses, and it is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses. When the DNS server receives a request for a domain name, it checks its database to see if it has the IP address for that domain name. If it does, it sends the IP address back to your computer in a DNS response. Your computer then uses the IP address to connect to the website's server. If the DNS server does not have the IP address for the requested domain name, it will forward the request to another DNS server, and the process repeats until the IP address is found.
Back to the process - this server acts as a directory for the internet, containing a database of domain names and their corresponding IP addresses. When the DNS server receives the request, it looks up the IP address for the website and sends it back to your computer. An IP address is a unique numerical identifier that is assigned to each device on a network. It is a 32-bit or 128-bit number that is written as four decimal numbers separated by dots, such as 172.217.17.206. Each number can range from 0 to 255. IP addresses are used to identify and locate devices on a network. When you type a domain name into your web browser, the DNS system translates the domain name into the corresponding IP address, and your computer uses that address to establish a connection to the website's server.
Once your computer has the IP address, it uses the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) to establish a connection with the server hosting the website. TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is a transport layer protocol that is used to establish and maintain connections for the transmission of data between two computers. TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol, which means that it establishes a connection between two computers before any data is transmitted, and it ensures that the data is delivered reliably and in the correct order. It does this by using a sequence number and an acknowledgement system to keep track of which data has been sent and received. TCP is typically used in conjunction with other protocols, such as HTTP for the transmission of web page data, or SMTP for the transmission of email data. It is an important part of the internet's infrastructure, and it plays a crucial role in the reliable transmission of data across networks.This involves sending a series of packets back and forth between your computer and the server. The packets contain the information needed to establish the connection and transfer the website's content.
When the packets reach the server, they pass through any firewalls in place for security. A firewall is a security system that controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall can be hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both. The main function of a firewall is to protect a private network from unauthorized access by external networks, such as the internet. It does this by monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on pre-defined security rules. These rules can be set to allow or block certain types of traffic based on factors such as the source or destination IP address, the port number, or the type of data being transmitted. If the packets pass the inspection, they are forwarded to a load balancer.
A load balancer is a networking device that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers or resources in order to improve the performance and availability of a network. It does this by monitoring the incoming traffic and routing it to the appropriate server or resource in a way that maximizes efficiency and minimizes response time. Load balancers are commonly used in web applications to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers. This helps to ensure that the application remains available and responsive, even when there is a high volume of traffic or when one of the servers becomes unavailable. Load balancers can be hardware-based or software-based, and they can be configured to use various algorithms to determine how to distribute traffic. Some common algorithms used by load balancers include round-robin, least connections, and least response time. Once the packets have been forwarded to a web server, the server assembles the website's content and sends it back to your computer.
A web server is a computer that stores and serves the files that make up a website. When a user accesses a website by entering a domain name into their web browser, the browser sends a request to the web server that hosts the website. The web server then retrieves the requested files and sends them back to the user's browser, which renders the website on the user's computer. Web servers are typically powerful computers with large amounts of memory and storage. They run specialized software, such as Apache or Microsoft IIS, that is designed to handle the many requests that they receive from users. In addition to serving the files that make up a website, web servers can also perform other functions, such as executing server-side scripts, processing server-side applications, or storing and managing user data.
To protect the data being transferred, the web server uses HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). HTTPS is the secure version of the standard protocol for transferring web page data (HTTP), and SSL encrypts the data to prevent it from being intercepted and read by anyone other than your computer. When you access a website using HTTPS, your computer establishes a secure, encrypted connection to the website's server. This encryption ensures that any data transmitted between your computer and the server remains private and secure, and it helps protect against attackers who might try to intercept or tamper with the data. One of the main differences between HTTP and HTTPS is that HTTPS uses a secure SSL/TLS connection to encrypt the data being transmitted. This connection is established using a special security certificate that is issued by a trusted certificate authority. In addition to providing encryption and security, HTTPS also provides authentication. This means that when you access a website using HTTPS, you can be confident that you are communicating with the server that you intended to, and not with an attacker who is trying to impersonate the server. As the website's content is sent back to your computer, the packets pass through the firewall again.
Once the packets reach your computer, they are reassembled into the website's content and displayed on your screen. This entire process happens very quickly, allowing you to access the website almost instantly.
